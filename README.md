Loner

Overview

Loner is a React application that helps you find hikes within a specified radius of a search location and provides historical foot traffic data along with current busyness. This data is synthesized since it was not easily available through traditional sources. Loner utilizes various technologies, including the Google Maps JavaScript API, a weather API, and Auth0 for authentication. The application is built using React for the frontend, MongoDB for the database, and Node.js for the backend.
